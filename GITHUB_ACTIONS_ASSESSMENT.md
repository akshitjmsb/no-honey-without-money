# GitHub Actions Assessment & Improvement Plan

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ **What's Already Good**
1. **Basic CI Pipeline**: Has a working CI workflow
2. **Security Checks**: Includes npm audit and secret scanning
3. **Multi-Node Setup**: Uses Node.js 18
4. **Caching**: Implements npm cache
5. **Build Verification**: Checks if build output exists

### ⚠️ **Areas for Improvement**

#### 1. **Missing Critical Steps**
- No linting in CI
- No code formatting checks
- No test coverage reporting
- No deployment automation
- No dependency updates

#### 2. **Outdated Practices**
- Using Node.js 18 (should be 20+)
- No matrix testing
- No parallel job optimization
- Missing security best practices

#### 3. **Missing Best Practices**
- No PR status checks
- No branch protection rules
- No automated releases
- No performance testing
- No accessibility testing

## Current Rating: C+ (Needs Significant Improvement)
